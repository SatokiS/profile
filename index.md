## Work experiences

### Summer intern at [Archipelago technology](https://www.archipelagotechnology.com/)
- The task I tackled at Archipelago Technology was to develop an IoT system that enables Archipelago Technology’s employees to monitor machine conditions at Archipelago’s clients' test facility. Conventionally people from Archipelago’s clients must monitor machine conditions using scopes and send the data to Archipelago Technology. This is labour demanding process, and my task was essentially to automate this process. One of the challenging parts of this task was that I need to make an IoT system that is compatible with high-frequency data since high-frequency data requires faster processing and buffer to store data temporary due to the amount of data generated per second. To overcome this problem, a machine called AMCI analogue inspection and an IoT Gateway(Raspberry Pi) was introduced. With these tools, I made a prototype that can collect sensor values and save them as CSV files and remotely transfer these files to the company’s PC. 

### Summer intern at [Aerosense](https://aerosense.co.jp/english)
- Aerosense, a SONY and ZMP's joint venture, is an industry-leading UAV solution company.
- Here at Aerosense, I have been involved in a project about depth estimation of images for collision avoidance.
